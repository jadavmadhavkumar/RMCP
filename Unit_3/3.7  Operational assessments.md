# **Operational Assessments**

## **Introduction**

Operational Assessment is a **systematic evaluation of day-to-day operational processes, controls, and practices** of an organization to identify **risks, weaknesses, and gaps** that may affect security, efficiency, compliance, and performance.

In **risk management and information security**, operational assessments help ensure that **policies and controls are effectively implemented in real operations**, not just documented.

---

## **Objectives of Operational Assessment**

- To evaluate the **effectiveness of operational controls**
    
- To identify **operational risks and vulnerabilities**
    
- To ensure **compliance** with policies, standards, and regulations
    
- To improve **efficiency, reliability, and security**
    
- To support **risk mitigation and decision-making**
    

---

## **Scope of Operational Assessment**

Operational assessments typically cover:

- People (roles, responsibilities, training)
    
- Processes (workflows, procedures)
    
- Technology (systems, tools, infrastructure)
    
- Physical and environmental controls
    
- Incident handling and response mechanisms
    

---

## **Key Components of Operational Assessment**

### **1. Process Evaluation**

- Review of standard operating procedures (SOPs)
    
- Identification of process gaps and inefficiencies
    
- Verification of process adherence
    

### **2. Control Effectiveness**

- Assessment of technical and administrative controls
    
- Verification of access controls, logging, and monitoring
    
- Testing preventive and detective controls
    

### **3. Risk Identification**

- Identification of operational risks such as:
    
    - Human errors
        
    - System failures
        
    - Process breakdowns
        
    - Insider threats
        

### **4. Compliance Verification**

- Checking adherence to:
    
    - Organizational policies
        
    - Regulatory requirements (ISO, NIST, etc.)
        
    - Internal guidelines
        

### **5. Incident and Response Review**

- Analysis of past incidents
    
- Review of incident response procedures
    
- Assessment of recovery and escalation processes

## **Operational Assessment Process**

1. **Planning**
    
    - Define objectives and scope
        
    - Identify systems and operations to be assessed
        
2. **Data Collection**
    
    - Interviews with staff
        
    - Observation of operational activities
        
    - Review of logs, reports, and documents
        
3. **Analysis**
    
    - Identify control gaps
        
    - Assess likelihood and impact of risks
        
4. **Reporting**
    
    - Document findings
        
    - Rate risks (Low, Medium, High)
        
5. **Recommendations**
    
    - Suggest corrective actions
        
    - Propose process and control improvements

## **Benefits of Operational Assessments**

- Early identification of operational risks
    
- Improved security posture
    
- Enhanced operational efficiency
    
- Reduced downtime and losses
    
- Better regulatory compliance

## **Scenario (Exam-Friendly Example)**

### **Scenario: Data Center Operations in an IT Company**

An IT company performs an **operational assessment** of its **data center operations**.

### **Findings from the Assessment**

- Backup procedures are defined but **not consistently followed**
    
- Access to server rooms is **not regularly reviewed**
    
- Incident response drills are **not conducted**
    
- Monitoring logs are **not analyzed daily**
    

### **Risks Identified**

- Data loss due to improper backups → **High Risk**
    
- Unauthorized physical access → **Medium Risk**
    
- Delayed incident response → **High Risk**
    

### **Recommendations**

- Automate and monitor backup processes
    
- Enforce regular access reviews
    
- Conduct periodic incident response drills
    
- Improve log monitoring procedures
    

### **Outcome**

The operational assessment helps the organization **reduce operational risks**, improve **system availability**, and strengthen **overall security**.

## **Difference Between Operational Assessment and Risk Assessment**

|Aspect|Operational Assessment|Risk Assessment|
|---|---|---|
|Focus|Day-to-day operations|Identification and analysis of risks|
|Nature|Practical and process-oriented|Analytical and strategic|
|Outcome|Process improvements|Risk prioritization|

---

## **Conclusion**

Operational assessments play a **critical role in risk management** by ensuring that **security controls and processes function effectively in real-world operations**.  
They bridge the gap between **policy and practice**, enabling organizations to proactively manage risks and improve operational resilience.
