# **Risk Evaluation**

## **Definition**

Risk Evaluation is the process of **comparing identified and analyzed risks** against **predefined risk criteria** to determine their **significance and priority**.  
It helps organizations decide **which risks need treatment**, **which can be accepted**, and **which require immediate action**.

---

## **Position in Risk Management Process**

Risk Evaluation comes **after Risk Assessment** and **before Risk Treatment**.

**Flow:**  
Risk Identification → Risk Analysis → **Risk Evaluation** → Risk Treatment

---

## **Objectives of Risk Evaluation**

- To **prioritize risks** based on severity
    
- To support **management decision-making**
    
- To determine **acceptable vs unacceptable risks**
    
- To allocate **resources efficiently**
    
- To ensure compliance with standards (ISO 27001, NIST)
    

---

## **Key Elements of Risk Evaluation**

### **1. Risk Criteria**

Risk criteria define what level of risk is acceptable.  
They are based on:

- Business objectives
    
- Legal and regulatory requirements
    
- Financial tolerance
    
- Organizational risk appetite
    

---

### **2. Risk Ranking and Prioritization**

Risks are ranked using:

- **Likelihood** (probability of occurrence)
    
- **Impact** (severity of consequences)
    

Often represented using a **Risk Matrix** (Low, Medium, High).

---

### **3. Risk Acceptance Decision**

After evaluation, risks are categorized as:

- **Acceptable Risk** – no action needed
    
- **Tolerable Risk** – monitoring required
    
- **Unacceptable Risk** – immediate mitigation required
    

---

### **4. Documentation**

Results of risk evaluation are documented as:

- Risk register
    
- Risk heat maps
    
- Management reports
    

---

## **Methods Used in Risk Evaluation**

- Risk Matrix
    
- Cost–benefit analysis
    
- Qualitative evaluation
    
- Quantitative evaluation
    
- Risk scoring techniques

## **Nice Exam Scenario**

### **Scenario: E-Commerce Company**

An e-commerce company handles **online payments and customer data**.

### **Identified Risk**

Data breach due to **unpatched web application vulnerability**.

### **Risk Analysis Results**

Risk evaluation helped management:

- Prioritize the risk
    
- Allocate budget
    
- Prevent future incidents
