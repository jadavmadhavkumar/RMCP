## **Risk Assessment Techniques**

### **Introduction**

Risk assessment techniques are systematic methods used to **identify, analyze, and evaluate risks** that may affect an organization’s information assets.  
These techniques help organizations understand **what can go wrong**, **how severe the impact could be**, and **how likely the risk is to occur**, so that appropriate controls can be applied.

---

### **Objectives of Risk Assessment**

- Identify threats and vulnerabilities
    
- Evaluate likelihood and impact of risks
    
- Prioritize risks based on severity
    
- Support decision-making for risk treatment
    
- Ensure compliance with security standards (NIST, ISO 27001)
    

---

## **Major Risk Assessment Techniques**

### **1. Qualitative Risk Assessment**

- Uses **descriptive values** instead of numbers
    
- Impact and likelihood are rated as **Low, Medium, High**
    
- Based on expert judgment, interviews, and experience
    

**Advantages**

- Easy to understand
    
- Quick to perform
    
- Suitable when data is limited
    

**Disadvantages**

- Subjective
    
- Less precise
    

**Example:**  
Data breach risk rated as **High impact** and **Medium likelihood**

---

### **2. Quantitative Risk Assessment**

- Uses **numerical values** and financial data
    
- Calculates potential loss in monetary terms
    

**Key Formula:**  
**Risk = Asset Value × Threat × Vulnerability**

**Advantages**

- Objective and measurable
    
- Useful for cost-benefit analysis
    

**Disadvantages**

- Requires accurate data
    
- Time-consuming
    

**Example:**  
Annual loss expectancy (ALE) of ₹10,00,000 due to system failure

---

### **3. Asset-Based Risk Assessment**

- Focuses on identifying **critical assets**
    
- Assesses risks based on asset value
    

**Steps**

1. Identify assets
    
2. Determine threats and vulnerabilities
    
3. Assess impact
    

**Example:**  
Customer database identified as a high-value asset

---

### **4. Threat-Based Risk Assessment**

- Starts with identifying **possible threats**
    
- Evaluates how threats exploit vulnerabilities
    

**Common Threats**

- Malware
    
- Insider attacks
    
- Natural disasters
    

**Example:**  
Ransomware attack on servers

---

### **5. Vulnerability-Based Risk Assessment**

- Identifies **system weaknesses**
    
- Uses vulnerability scans and penetration testing
    

**Tools Used**

- Nessus
    
- OpenVAS
    

**Example:**  
Unpatched operating system vulnerability

---

### **6. Scenario-Based Risk Assessment**

- Uses **real-world scenarios**
    
- Helps understand impact and response
    

**Advantages**

- Practical
    
- Easy to visualize
    

---

## **Scenario Example (Very Important for Exam)**

### **Scenario: E-Commerce Website**

An organization runs an **online shopping website**.

**Asset:** Customer payment database  
**Threat:** SQL injection attack  
**Vulnerability:** Poor input validation  
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** High (financial loss, data breach, reputation damage)

### **Assessment Using Techniques**

- **Qualitative:** High risk
    
- **Quantitative:** Estimated loss ₹50 lakhs per year
    
- **Asset-based:** Critical asset at risk
    
- **Threat-based:** External cyber attack
    
- **Vulnerability-based:** Application security flaw
    

### **Final Risk Level:** **HIGH**

---

### **Risk Assessment Process (Steps)**

1. Identify assets
    
2. Identify threats and vulnerabilities
    
3. Analyze likelihood and impact
    
4. Evaluate and prioritize risks
    
5. Recommend controls
    

---

### **Conclusion**

Risk assessment techniques provide a **structured approach to identifying and managing risks**.  
Using a combination of **qualitative, quantitative, and scenario-based techniques** ensures effective risk management and improved organizational security.

### **Easy Memory Tip**

**“Asset → Threat → Vulnerability → Impact → Control”**
