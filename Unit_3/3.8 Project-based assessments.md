# **Project-Based Assessments**

## **Definition**

Project-Based Assessment is a **risk assessment approach** conducted for a **specific project** such as development of a new system, implementation of new technology, or major system change.  
It identifies, analyzes, and mitigates **security, operational, and compliance risks** associated with that project before and during its execution.

---

## **Objectives**

- Identify project-specific risks early
    
- Ensure security is built into the project lifecycle
    
- Reduce cost of fixing issues later
    
- Ensure compliance with organizational and regulatory standards
    
- Support informed decision-making
    

---

## **When Project-Based Assessments Are Required**

- New system or application development
    
- Cloud migration projects
    
- ERP or core banking implementation
    
- Infrastructure upgrades
    
- Third-party system integration
    

---

## **Key Steps in Project-Based Assessment**

### **1. Project Understanding**

- Define project scope, goals, and stakeholders
    
- Identify critical assets involved
    

### **2. Risk Identification**

- Identify threats (technical, operational, human, legal)
    
- Identify vulnerabilities in design, process, and technology
    

### **3. Risk Analysis**

- Analyze likelihood and impact of identified risks
    
- Categorize risks as Low, Medium, or High
    

### **4. Risk Evaluation**

- Compare risks against risk appetite
    
- Decide which risks are acceptable
    

### **5. Risk Treatment**

- Apply controls: preventive, detective, and corrective
    
- Avoid, mitigate, transfer, or accept risks
    

### **6. Documentation & Reporting**

- Prepare risk register
    
- Provide assessment report to management

## **Benefits of Project-Based Assessments**

- Improves project success rate
    
- Prevents security breaches
    
- Ensures regulatory compliance
    
- Saves time and cost
    
- Improves stakeholder confidence

## **Scenario (Exam-Friendly Example)**

### **Scenario: Online Payment System Implementation**

A financial organization plans to implement a **new online payment system**.

### **Identified Risks**

- Unauthorized access due to weak authentication
    
- Data leakage during payment processing
    
- Integration issues with third-party payment gateway
    
- Downtime during peak transaction hours
    

### **Risk Analysis**

- Data breach → **High Impact**
    
- System downtime → **Medium Impact**
    
- Integration failure → **Medium Impact**
    

### **Risk Mitigation Measures**

- Implement multi-factor authentication
    
- Encrypt data in transit and at rest
    
- Perform penetration testing before launch
    
- Establish backup and disaster recovery plans
    

### **Outcome**

The project-based assessment helps management **identify and control risks before deployment**, ensuring a **secure and reliable system launch**.

## **Comparison with Operational Assessment**

|Project-Based Assessment|Operational Assessment|
|---|---|
|Focuses on specific project|Focuses on ongoing operations|
|Temporary in nature|Continuous process|
|Conducted before/during project|Conducted regularly|

---

## **Conclusion**

Project-Based Assessments play a vital role in **risk management** by ensuring that security and risk considerations are integrated into projects from the beginning.  
They help organizations deliver **secure, compliant, and successful projects**.
