# **Threat Identification**

## **Definition**

Threat Identification is the process of **recognizing, listing, and understanding potential threats** that can exploit vulnerabilities and cause harm to an organization’s **information systems, data, operations, or reputation**.

A **threat** is any event, action, or actor that has the potential to **negatively impact confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA)** of information.

---

## **Objectives of Threat Identification**

- Identify possible sources of harm
    
- Understand how systems can be attacked or disrupted
    
- Support effective risk assessment
    
- Enable proactive security controls
    
- Reduce likelihood of security incidents

## **Sources of Threats**

### **1. External Threats**

- Hackers and cybercriminals
    
- Malware, ransomware
    
- Phishing and social engineering
    
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
    

### **2. Internal Threats**

- Malicious insiders
    
- Human error
    
- Misuse of privileges
    

### **3. Environmental / Natural Threats**

- Fire, flood, earthquake
    
- Power failure
    

### **4. Technical Threats**

- Software bugs
    
- System failures
    
- Network outages
    

---

## **Common Threat Categories**

- **Information disclosure**
    
- **Data manipulation**
    
- **Service disruption**
    
- **Unauthorized access**
    
- **Fraud and theft**
    

---

## **Threat Identification Methods**

### **1. Asset-Based Analysis**

- Identify threats for each critical asset
    

### **2. Threat Modeling**

- Use models like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege)
    

### **3. Historical Data Review**

- Analyze past security incidents
    

### **4. Vulnerability Assessments**

- Identify threats that can exploit known weaknesses
    

### **5. Threat Intelligence**

- Use external threat feeds and advisories
    

### **6. Expert Judgment**

- Brainstorming sessions with security experts
    

---

## **Importance of Threat Identification**

- Forms the foundation of risk management
    
- Prevents surprise attacks
    
- Helps prioritize security investments
    
- Supports compliance and governance
    
- Improves organizational resilience

## **Scenario (Exam-Friendly Example)**

### **Scenario: University Information System**

A university maintains an online system containing **student records, exam results, and fee payments**.

### **Identified Threats**

- Hackers attempting unauthorized access to student data
    
- Insider threat from staff misusing privileges
    
- Phishing emails targeting students and faculty
    
- Server failure during peak exam result periods
    

### **Impact**

- Data leakage of personal information
    
- Loss of trust and reputation
    
- System downtime affecting students
    

### **Action Taken**

- Threats identified during risk assessment
    
- Security controls planned to mitigate risks
    

### **Outcome**

Early threat identification enables the university to **apply security measures**, preventing data breaches and service disruption.

## **Difference Between Threat and Vulnerability**

|Threat|Vulnerability|
|---|---|
|Potential cause of harm|Weakness in system|
|Can be intentional or accidental|Can be technical or procedural|
|Cannot always be eliminated|Can be reduced or fixed|

---

## **Conclusion**

Threat Identification is a **critical first step in risk management**.  
By identifying threats early, organizations can **proactively design controls**, reduce risks, and protect critical assets effectively.
