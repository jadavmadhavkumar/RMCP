# **Threat and Vulnerability Management**

## **Definition**

Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM) is a **systematic process** of identifying, analyzing, prioritizing, and mitigating **security threats and vulnerabilities** that may affect an organization’s information systems, networks, and data.

- **Threat**: A potential cause of harm (e.g., hackers, malware, insider attacks).
    
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness that can be exploited by a threat (e.g., unpatched software).
    

---

## **Objectives**

- Identify potential threats to systems
    
- Detect vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them
    
- Reduce security incidents and data breaches
    
- Improve overall security posture
    
- Ensure business continuity and compliance
    

---

## **Types of Threats**

- **External threats**: Hackers, malware, phishing, DDoS attacks
    
- **Internal threats**: Insider misuse, human error
    
- **Natural threats**: Fire, flood, power failure
    
- **Technical threats**: Software bugs, misconfigurations
    

---

## **Types of Vulnerabilities**

- Unpatched software
    
- Weak passwords
    
- Misconfigured firewalls
    
- Lack of encryption
    
- Outdated systems
    

---

## **Threat and Vulnerability Management Process**

### **1. Asset Identification**

- Identify critical assets (servers, databases, applications)
    

### **2. Threat Identification**

- Identify possible threats to each asset
    

### **3. Vulnerability Identification**

- Conduct vulnerability scanning and assessments
    

### **4. Risk Analysis**

- Evaluate likelihood and impact of threats exploiting vulnerabilities
    

### **5. Prioritization**

- Rank vulnerabilities as High, Medium, or Low risk
    

### **6. Mitigation and Remediation**

- Apply patches and updates
    
- Strengthen access controls
    
- Configure firewalls and IDS/IPS
    

### **7. Monitoring and Review**

- Continuous monitoring
    
- Regular reassessment
    

---

## **Tools Used**

- Vulnerability scanners (Nessus, Qualys)
    
- Threat intelligence feeds
    
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
    
- Penetration testing
    

---

## **Benefits**

- Prevents cyber attacks
    
- Improves system reliability
    
- Reduces downtime and financial loss
    
- Ensures regulatory compliance
    
- Enhances organizational security posture

## **Scenario (Exam-Friendly Example)**

### **Scenario: E-Commerce Website**

An e-commerce company operates an online shopping platform.

### **Identified Threats**

- Hackers attempting SQL injection
    
- Phishing attacks targeting customers
    
- Malware infection on web servers
    

### **Identified Vulnerabilities**

- Outdated web application framework
    
- Weak database access controls
    

### **Risk Management Actions**

- Conduct vulnerability scans
    
- Patch outdated software
    
- Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)
    
- Enable multi-factor authentication
    

### **Outcome**

By managing threats and vulnerabilities proactively, the company **prevents data breaches**, protects customer information, and ensures **continuous service availability**.

## **Difference Between Threat and Vulnerability**

|Threat|Vulnerability|
|---|---|
|Potential cause of harm|Weakness in system|
|External or internal|Technical or procedural|
|Cannot always be removed|Can be fixed or reduced|

---

## **Conclusion**

Threat and Vulnerability Management is a **continuous and proactive security process**.  
It helps organizations **identify weaknesses**, protect critical assets, and minimize the impact of security incidents.

---

### **Memory Tip**

**“Threat + Vulnerability = Risk  
Manage both to reduce risk”**
