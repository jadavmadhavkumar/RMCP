## **Qualitative Risk Measures**

### **Introduction**

Qualitative Risk Measures are methods used to **evaluate and prioritize risks based on descriptive scales** rather than numerical values.  
They rely on **expert judgment, experience, and observation** to assess the **likelihood and impact** of risks.

This approach is widely used in **information security risk management** when exact numerical data is unavailable.

---

### **Definition**

Qualitative risk measurement is the process of assessing risk using **categories such as High, Medium, and Low** to represent the **probability of occurrence and severity of impact** of a risk.

---

### **Purpose of Qualitative Risk Measures**

- To identify and prioritize risks quickly
    
- To support **early-stage risk assessment**
    
- To simplify risk understanding for management
    
- To help in decision-making without complex calculations
    
- To evaluate risks when **quantitative data is not available**

### **Key Components of Qualitative Risk Measures**

1. **Risk Likelihood (Probability)**  
    Describes how likely a risk is to occur.
    
    - Rare
        
    - Unlikely
        
    - Possible
        
    - Likely
        
    - Almost Certain
        
2. **Risk Impact (Consequence)**  
    Describes the severity of damage if the risk occurs.
    
    - Low
        
    - Medium
        
    - High
        
    - Very High
        
3. **Risk Rating**  
    Combination of **likelihood and impact** to determine overall risk level.
    
    - Low Risk
        
    - Medium Risk
        
    - High Risk
        
    - Critical Risk

### **Qualitative Risk Matrix**

A **risk matrix** is commonly used to map **likelihood vs impact**.

|Likelihood \ Impact|Low|Medium|High|
|---|---|---|---|
|Low|Low|Low|Medium|
|Medium|Low|Medium|High|
|High|Medium|High|Critical|

This matrix helps organizations **visually prioritize risks**.

### **Techniques Used in Qualitative Risk Measurement**

- Brainstorming sessions
    
- Expert interviews
    
- Checklists
    
- Workshops
    
- Historical data review
    
- Scenario analysis
    

---

### **Advantages of Qualitative Risk Measures**

- Simple and easy to understand
    
- No mathematical calculations required
    
- Cost-effective and time-saving
    
- Suitable for **small and medium organizations**
    
- Encourages team participation
    

---

### **Limitations**

- Subjective in nature
    
- Depends heavily on expert opinion
    
- Results may vary between assessors
    
- Not suitable for detailed financial analysis
    

---

### **Example Scenario**

**Risk:** Phishing attack on employee email system

- **Likelihood:** High (frequent phishing emails)
    
- **Impact:** Medium (data exposure possible)
    
- **Overall Risk:** High
    

This risk should be **addressed immediately** using security awareness training and email filtering.

---

### **Conclusion**

Qualitative risk measures provide a **structured and simple approach** to identify and prioritize risks when numerical data is unavailable.  
They are especially useful in **information security risk management** for making **quick and effective decisions**.
