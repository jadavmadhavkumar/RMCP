Here’s a **complete, exam-ready answer** on **Access Control Models** for **10+ marks**, structured neatly, simple, and easy to memorize. I’ve included **definition, types, key features, advantages, and examples** so you can write it fully in exams.

## **Access Control Models**

### **Definition**

An **Access Control Model** is a framework that defines **how users gain access to resources** in a system and what operations they are allowed to perform.  
It ensures **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of data.

---

### **Purpose**

- Prevent unauthorized access to resources
    
- Ensure users can only perform **authorized actions**
    
- Protect sensitive data
    
- Support **security policies**
    

---

### **Types of Access Control Models**

#### **1. Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**

- **Definition:** Access is granted by the **owner of the resource**.
    
- **Key Feature:** Owner decides who can access files or data.
    
- **Example:** File permissions in Windows or Linux (`read, write, execute`).
    
- **Advantages:** Flexible and easy to implement.
    
- **Disadvantages:** Less secure; risk of accidental or intentional misuse.
    

---

#### **2. Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**

- **Definition:** Access is controlled by **system-enforced rules** based on **security labels**.
    
- **Key Feature:** Users **cannot change permissions**; access depends on clearance and classification.
    
- **Example:** Military classification levels (Top Secret, Secret, Confidential).
    
- **Advantages:** Highly secure; ideal for sensitive information.
    
- **Disadvantages:** Less flexible; complex to manage.
    

---

#### **3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- **Definition:** Access is granted based on the **user’s role** in the organization.
    
- **Key Feature:** Permissions are assigned to roles, and users inherit them.
    
- **Example:** In a bank:
    
    - Teller → can view customer accounts
        
    - Manager → can approve loans
        
- **Advantages:** Easy to manage for large organizations; aligns with organizational structure.
    
- **Disadvantages:** Role explosion may occur if too many roles are defined.
    

---

#### **4. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**

- **Definition:** Access is granted based on **attributes** (user, resource, environment).
    
- **Key Feature:** Dynamic access control using policies and rules.
    
- **Example:** A user can access a document **only during office hours** from a secure device.
    
- **Advantages:** Flexible; fine-grained control; policy-driven.
    
- **Disadvantages:** Complex to configure; requires careful policy management.
    

---

#### **5. Rule-Based Access Control**

- **Definition:** Access is based on **predefined system rules**, often implemented using security policies or firewalls.
    
- **Example:** Firewall rules allowing traffic only from specific IP addresses.
    
- **Advantages:** Easy to implement in networked systems.
    
- **Disadvantages:** Not suitable for very dynamic environments.

### **Comparison Table for Quick Revision**

|Model|Controlled by|Flexibility|Security Level|Example|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|DAC|Owner|High|Low|File permissions|
|MAC|System|Low|High|Military data|
|RBAC|Roles|Medium|Medium|Bank roles|
|ABAC|Attributes|High|High|Conditional access|
|Rule-Based|Predefined rules|Medium|Medium|Firewall rules|

---

### **Scenario Example (for exams)**

**Scenario:** Hospital Management System

- **Doctor Role:** Can access patient records (RBAC)
    
- **Nurse Role:** Can only update vital signs (RBAC)
    
- **Sensitive lab reports:** Only accessible by lab head (MAC)
    
- **Access allowed only during shifts:** (ABAC)
    

This demonstrates **how multiple access control models are applied** in real life.

---

### **Conclusion**

Access control models provide a **structured way to secure information systems**.  
Choosing the right model depends on:

- Sensitivity of data
    
- Organizational structure
    
- Regulatory and compliance requirements
