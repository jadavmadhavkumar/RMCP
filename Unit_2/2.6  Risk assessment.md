# **Risk Assessment**

## **Introduction**
Risk Assessment is a **systematic process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risks** that may affect an organization’s information assets.  
It helps organizations understand **what can go wrong, how likely it is, and what the impact will be**, so that appropriate controls can be applied.

---

## **Definition**
Risk Assessment is the process of **identifying threats and vulnerabilities**, analyzing the **likelihood and impact** of their occurrence, and determining the **level of risk** to organizational assets.

---

## **Objectives of Risk Assessment**
- Identify **critical assets and risks**
- Understand potential **threats and vulnerabilities**
- Determine **risk levels**
- Prioritize risks for **treatment**
- Support **management decision-making**
- Ensure **regulatory and security compliance**

---

## **Components of Risk Assessment**
Risk Assessment mainly consists of **three components**:

1. **Risk Identification**
2. **Risk Analysis**
3. **Risk Evaluation**

---

## **1. Risk Identification**
This step identifies:
- **Assets** (data, systems, people)
- **Threats** (hackers, malware, insider threats)
- **Vulnerabilities** (weak passwords, outdated software)

Example:  
Asset – Customer database  
Threat – Cyber attacker  
Vulnerability – Unpatched server  

---

## **2. Risk Analysis**
Risk Analysis determines:
- **Likelihood** of the risk occurring
- **Impact** if the risk occurs

### Types of Risk Analysis:
- **Qualitative**: Uses terms like Low, Medium, High  
- **Quantitative**: Uses numerical values (cost, probability)

**Risk Formula:**  
**Risk = Likelihood × Impact**

---

## **3. Risk Evaluation**
- Compare analyzed risks against **risk acceptance criteria**
- Categorize risks as **Low, Medium, or High**
- Decide which risks need immediate attention

---

## **Risk Assessment Process (Steps)**
1. Asset identification  
2. Threat identification  
3. Vulnerability identification  
4. Likelihood assessment  
5. Impact assessment  
6. Risk calculation  
7. Risk prioritization  
8. Documentation and reporting  

---

## **Risk Treatment Options**
After assessment, risks can be handled by:
- **Risk Mitigation** – Apply security controls  
- **Risk Avoidance** – Stop the risky activity  
- **Risk Transfer** – Insurance or outsourcing  
- **Risk Acceptance** – Accept low-level risks  

---

## **Scenario Example (Exam-Friendly)**

### **Scenario: Hospital Information System**

**Asset:** Patient medical records  
**Threat:** Ransomware attack  
**Vulnerability:** Outdated operating system  

**Analysis:**
- Likelihood: High  
- Impact: High (data loss, legal penalties)

**Risk Level:** High  

**Action:** Immediate mitigation using patches, backups, and access controls.

---

## **Benefits of Risk Assessment**
- Improves **security posture**
- Prevents financial and data losses
- Enhances **business continuity**
- Ensures compliance with standards like **ISO 27001, NIST**
- Helps in proactive decision-making

---

## **Conclusion**
Risk Assessment is a **critical foundation of risk management**.  
By identifying and analyzing risks, organizations can **protect their assets, reduce uncertainties, and ensure secure and reliable operations**.
