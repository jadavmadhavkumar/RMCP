Here is a **10-mark, exam-ready answer** on **Risk Impact Categorization**, written **simple, short, and easy to remember**, with **one clear scenario**.

## **Risk Impact Categorization**

### **Definition**

Risk Impact Categorization is the process of **classifying the effect (impact)** of a risk on an organization if the risk event occurs.  
It helps management **prioritize risks** based on how severely they affect **confidentiality, integrity, availability, finances, operations, and reputation**.

---

### **Purpose**

- To understand **how serious a risk is**
    
- To **prioritize risks** for treatment
    
- To support **decision-making** and resource allocation
    
- To align with frameworks like **NIST, ISO 27001**
    

---

### **Impact Categories**

Risk impact is commonly divided into **three levels**:

1. **Low Impact**
    
    - Minor disruption
        
    - No major financial or operational loss
        
    - Easily recoverable
        
2. **Medium Impact**
    
    - Noticeable disruption
        
    - Moderate financial loss
        
    - Temporary service downtime
        
3. **High Impact**
    
    - Severe operational failure
        
    - Major financial loss
        
    - Legal issues, data breach, reputation damage
        

---

### **Impact Areas Considered**

- **Financial impact** (loss of revenue, fines)
    
- **Operational impact** (service downtime)
    
- **Reputational impact** (loss of customer trust)
    
- **Legal/Compliance impact**
    
- **Security impact** (CIA triad)
    

---

## **Scenario (Exam-Friendly Example)**

### **Scenario: Online Banking System**

An organization runs an **online banking application**.

**Risk:** Unauthorized access due to weak authentication

**Impact Categorization:**

- **Confidentiality:** Customer financial data exposed → **High**
    
- **Integrity:** Transaction data may be altered → **High**
    
- **Availability:** Service disruption during investigation → **Medium**
    
- **Financial Impact:** Regulatory fines and compensation → **High**
    
- **Reputation Impact:** Loss of customer trust → **High**
    

### **Final Risk Impact Level:** **HIGH**

Because the risk affects **multiple critical areas**, it is categorized as **High Impact** and must be treated immediately.

---

### **Conclusion**

Risk impact categorization enables organizations to **identify the severity of risks**, focus on **high-impact threats**, and implement effective **risk mitigation strategies**.

---

### **Memory Tip (Easy to Remember)**

**“Low – Manage later  
Medium – Monitor closely  
High – Act immediately”**
