## **Risk Sensitivity Measurements**

### **Definition**

Risk Sensitivity Measurement is a technique used to **determine how changes in key risk factors affect the overall risk level** of an asset, system, or organization. It helps identify **which variables have the greatest impact on risk** so that controls can be prioritized effectively.

---

### **Purpose of Risk Sensitivity Measurements**

- To understand **how sensitive risk is to changes** in threats, vulnerabilities, or impacts
    
- To identify **critical risk drivers**
    
- To support **better decision-making and control selection**
    
- To prioritize mitigation efforts where they matter most
    

---

### **Key Elements Measured**

1. **Threat Likelihood** – Probability of a threat occurring
    
2. **Vulnerability Level** – Weaknesses that can be exploited
    
3. **Impact Severity** – Financial, operational, or reputational loss
    
4. **Control Effectiveness** – How well existing controls reduce risk

### **Methods Used**

- **What-if analysis**
    
- **Scenario analysis**
    
- **Sensitivity tables or charts**
    
- **Risk scoring adjustments**

## **Scenario (Easy to Remember for Exam)**

### **Scenario: Online Banking System**

An organization operates an **online banking system**.

- Initial Risk Factors:
    
    - Threat likelihood (cyber-attack): **Medium**
        
    - Vulnerability (outdated software): **Medium**
        
    - Impact (financial loss): **High**
        

**Initial Risk Level: Medium–High**

Now, a **risk sensitivity measurement** is performed:

- When vulnerability increases from **Medium to High** (due to delayed patching),
    
- The overall risk level increases from **Medium–High to Critical**.
    

This shows that **risk is highly sensitive to vulnerability changes**, so patch management becomes a **top priority**.

---

### **Conclusion**

Risk Sensitivity Measurement helps organizations **identify which risk factors influence risk the most**. By understanding sensitivity, organizations can **focus resources on the most impactful controls**, improving overall risk management effectiveness.
