Here’s a **complete, exam-ready answer** for **“Security Controls and Services”** suitable for **10+ marks**. I’ve written it in a **structured, easy-to-remember way**, with headings, examples, and a small diagram idea for visuals.

## **Security Controls and Services**

### **Definition**

- **Security Controls** are **safeguards or countermeasures** implemented to **protect information systems** from threats, vulnerabilities, and risks.
    
- **Security Services** are **functions provided by security controls** to ensure the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information**.
    

---

### **Purpose**

1. Protect organizational assets (data, systems, people).
    
2. Reduce the probability and impact of security incidents.
    
3. Ensure compliance with laws, standards, and regulations.
    
4. Build trust with customers, partners, and stakeholders.

### **Types of Security Controls**

Security controls are generally classified into **three main categories**:

#### 1. **Preventive Controls**

- **Purpose:** Stop security incidents **before they occur**.
    
- **Examples:**
    
    - Firewalls (prevent unauthorized access)
        
    - Access control lists (restrict permissions)
        
    - Encryption (protect data in transit/storage)
        
    - Strong authentication and passwords
        

#### 2. **Detective Controls**

- **Purpose:** Identify and **detect security incidents** after they occur.
    
- **Examples:**
    
    - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
        
    - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems
        
    - Log monitoring
        
    - Audit trails
        

#### 3. **Corrective Controls**

- **Purpose:** **Fix problems** and restore systems after an incident.
    
- **Examples:**
    
    - Patch management
        
    - Backup and recovery systems
        
    - Incident response plans
        
    - Disaster recovery procedures
        

#### 4. **Deterrent Controls (Optional for extra marks)**

- **Purpose:** Discourage attacks or misuse.
    
- **Examples:**
    
    - Warning banners
        
    - Security policies
        
    - Awareness training

### **Security Services**

Security services are **provided by implementing controls**, and include:

1. **Confidentiality:** Prevents unauthorized access to information.
    
    - Methods: Encryption, access control, masking.
        
2. **Integrity:** Ensures information is **accurate and unaltered**.
    
    - Methods: Hashing, digital signatures, checksums.
        
3. **Availability:** Ensures systems and data are **accessible when needed**.
    
    - Methods: Redundant servers, backups, disaster recovery plans.
        
4. **Authentication:** Confirms the identity of users/systems.
    
    - Methods: Passwords, biometrics, multi-factor authentication.
        
5. **Authorization:** Ensures users have **permission for specific actions**.
    
    - Methods: Role-based access control (RBAC), policies.
        
6. **Non-repudiation:** Ensures users **cannot deny their actions**.
    
    - Methods: Digital signatures, audit logs.
        
7. **Accountability:** Tracks user/system activities to ensure **responsibility**.
    
    - Methods: Logging, monitoring, audit trails.

### **Scenario for Clarity (Optional for 10+ Marks)**

**Scenario:** A company implements an **online payment system**.

- **Preventive Control:** SSL encryption → Protects transaction data.
    
- **Detective Control:** SIEM system → Detects unusual login attempts.
    
- **Corrective Control:** Daily backups → Restore data after a cyberattack.
    
- **Security Services Provided:**
    
    - Confidentiality → Customer data is safe
        
    - Integrity → Transactions are accurate
        
    - Availability → Payment system is always accessible
        

---

### **Conclusion**

- Security controls **prevent, detect, and correct** threats.
    
- Security services **ensure CIA, authentication, and accountability**.
    
- A **well-structured security program** uses multiple controls to **mitigate risk** effectively.

### **Memory Tip (Easy Recall)**

**“PDC + CIA + AAA = Security Safe”**

- **PDC** = Preventive, Detective, Corrective controls
    
- **CIA** = Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
    
- **AAA** = Authentication, Authorization, Accountability
