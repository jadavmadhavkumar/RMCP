Here is a **10-mark, exam-ready answer** on **Security Evolution**, written **simple, structured, and easy to memorize**, with **one clear scenario**.

---

## **Security Evolution**

### **Meaning**

Security evolution refers to the **gradual development of security practices** from basic physical protection to advanced **risk-based information security management**, in response to changing technologies and threats.

---

## **Stages of Security Evolution**

### **1. Physical Security Stage**

- Focus on protecting **buildings, hardware, and people**
    
- Locks, guards, CCTV, ID cards
    
- No concern for digital data
    

**Example:** Locking server rooms

---

### **2. Technical / Computer Security Stage**

- Protection of **individual computers**
    
- Passwords, antivirus, firewalls
    
- Security was handled by IT staff only
    

**Limitation:** Reactive, not planned

---

### **3. Information Security Stage**

- Protection of **data** (CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
    
- Policies, access controls, backups, encryption
    
- Awareness training introduced
    

---

### **4. Network and Internet Security Stage**

- Growth of networks and internet
    
- IDS/IPS, VPNs, secure protocols
    
- Protection against hackers and malware
    

---

### **5. Risk-Based Security Management Stage (Modern Era)**

- Focus on **identifying, analyzing, and managing risks**
    
- Risk assessment, risk mitigation, compliance (ISO, NIST)
    
- Security aligned with business goals
    

---

## **One Simple Scenario (Exam Friendly)**

**Scenario: Bank Security Evolution**

Initially, a bank protected its assets using **guards and locked vaults** (physical security).  
With computers, it introduced **passwords and antivirus** (computer security).  
As online banking grew, the bank adopted **encryption, firewalls, and access control** (information & network security).  
Today, the bank performs **risk assessments**, identifies threats like cyber fraud, and applies **risk-based controls** to protect customer data and ensure business continuity.

---

## **Conclusion**

Security has evolved from **protecting physical assets** to **managing information security risks**.  
Modern security focuses on **risk management**, ensuring business continuity, and protecting digital assets in a constantly changing threat environment.

### **Memory Tip (Easy to Remember):**

**Physical → Computer → Information → Network → Risk-Based Security**
