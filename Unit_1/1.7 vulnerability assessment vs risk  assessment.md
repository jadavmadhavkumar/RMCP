Here is a **10-mark, exam-ready answer** that is **short, clear, easy to remember**, and includes **one strong scenario** you can reproduce in the exam.

## **Vulnerability Assessment vs Risk Assessment**

### **Vulnerability Assessment (VA)**

Vulnerability Assessment is the process of **identifying, analyzing, and listing security weaknesses** in a system, network, or application.  
It focuses on **“what can be exploited”** without considering the business impact.

**Key points:**

- Identifies vulnerabilities (technical flaws)
    
- Does **not** measure impact or likelihood
    
- Mainly technical in nature
    
- Output: list of vulnerabilities with severity
    

**Example:**  
Finding unpatched software, open ports, weak passwords.

### **Risk Assessment (RA)**

Risk Assessment is the process of **evaluating the risk associated with vulnerabilities** by considering **likelihood and impact** on the organization.  
It answers **“how dangerous the vulnerability is to the business.”**

**Key points:**

- Considers threat, vulnerability, and impact
    
- Business-oriented approach
    
- Helps in decision-making
    
- Output: risk level (High / Medium / Low)
    

**Risk Formula:**  
**Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact**

## **Comparison Table**

|Aspect|Vulnerability Assessment|Risk Assessment|
|---|---|---|
|Focus|Finding weaknesses|Measuring risk|
|Considers impact|❌ No|✅ Yes|
|Business context|❌ No|✅ Yes|
|Output|List of vulnerabilities|Risk priority|
|Nature|Technical|Strategic|

## **Exam Scenario (Easy to Remember)**

**Scenario: Online Banking System**

- A vulnerability scan finds that the **database server is not patched**.
    

**Vulnerability Assessment Result:**

- Reports: _Unpatched database software_
    
- Severity: _High_
    
- Stops at identifying the weakness
    

**Risk Assessment Result:**

- Threat: Hacker attack
    
- Vulnerability: Unpatched database
    
- Impact: Loss of customer data, financial loss, legal penalties
    
- Risk Level: **High Risk**
    

**Decision:**  
Risk assessment helps management **prioritize patching immediately**.

---

## **Conclusion**

- **Vulnerability Assessment identifies weaknesses**
    
- **Risk Assessment evaluates the seriousness of those weaknesses**
    
- **VA is a subset of RA**
    
- Risk Assessment helps organizations **decide what to fix first**

### ✨ Memory Tip (One Line):

**“VA finds the holes, RA tells how dangerous the hole is.”**

If you want, I can also:

- Shorten this to **5–6 points**
    
- Make a **diagram-based answer**
    
- Convert it into **bullet-only exam format**
