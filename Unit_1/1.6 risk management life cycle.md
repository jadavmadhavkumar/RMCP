## **Risk Management Life Cycle**

### **Definition**

The **Risk Management Life Cycle** is a **systematic and continuous process** used to **identify, analyze, treat, and monitor risks** to protect an organization’s assets, information, and operations.

---

## **Phases of Risk Management Life Cycle**

### **1. Risk Identification**

- Identify **assets**, **threats**, and **vulnerabilities**
    
- Understand _what can go wrong_
    

**Examples:** malware, data breach, hardware failure

---

### **2. Risk Analysis / Assessment**

- Analyze **likelihood** and **impact** of identified risks
    
- Can be **qualitative** (low/medium/high) or **quantitative** (cost, loss)
    

---

### **3. Risk Evaluation / Prioritization**

- Compare risk levels against **acceptable risk criteria**
    
- Decide which risks need **immediate attention**
    

---

### **4. Risk Treatment / Mitigation**

Choose one of the following strategies:

- **Avoid** – eliminate the risk
    
- **Mitigate** – reduce impact or likelihood
    
- **Transfer** – insurance or outsourcing
    
- **Accept** – accept if risk is low
    

---

### **5. Risk Monitoring and Review**

- Continuously **monitor risks**
    
- Review effectiveness of controls
    
- Update risk register regularly
    

---

### **6. Documentation and Communication**

- Maintain **risk register**
    
- Report risks to management
    
- Support decision-making and audits
    

---

## **Simple Scenario (Exam-Friendly Example)**

### **Scenario: Risk Management in a College Online Exam System**

1. **Risk Identification**  
    Risk of **server failure** during online exams.
    
2. **Risk Analysis**
    
    - Likelihood: Medium
        
    - Impact: High (exam disruption, student complaints)
        
3. **Risk Evaluation**  
    Risk is **unacceptable** and must be treated.
    
4. **Risk Treatment**
    
    - Mitigation: Use **backup server** and **UPS**
        
    - Transfer: Cloud service SLA
        
5. **Risk Monitoring**
    
    - Regular server health checks
        
    - Mock tests before exams
        
6. **Documentation**
    
    - Risk recorded in **risk register**
        
    - Report shared with IT and exam department
        

---

## **Conclusion**

The Risk Management Life Cycle helps organizations **proactively manage risks**, reduce losses, ensure **business continuity**, and support **informed decision-making**.
