## **Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Analysis**

### **Introduction**

Risk analysis is a core part of risk management used to identify, evaluate, and prioritize risks. It helps organizations understand potential threats and decide suitable controls. Risk analysis is mainly of two types: **Qualitative** and **Quantitative**.

---

## **1. Qualitative Risk Analysis**

**Qualitative risk analysis** evaluates risk based on **descriptive scales** such as _High, Medium, or Low_. It relies on **expert judgment, experience, and observation** rather than numerical data.

### **Key Characteristics**

- Uses **non-numeric values**
    
- Easy and quick to perform
    
- Based on interviews, questionnaires, and risk matrices
    
- Useful when exact data is not available
    

### **Advantages**

- Simple and easy to understand
    
- Requires less time and cost
    
- Suitable for initial risk assessment
    

### **Limitations**

- Subjective in nature
    
- Less accurate than quantitative analysis

## **2. Quantitative Risk Analysis**

**Quantitative risk analysis** measures risk using **numerical values** such as monetary loss, probability, and frequency.

### **Key Characteristics**

- Uses **statistical and mathematical models**
    
- Provides measurable results in financial terms
    
- Common terms: **SLE, ARO, ALE**
    

### **Important Formulas**

- **SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)** = Asset Value × Exposure Factor
    
- **ARO (Annual Rate of Occurrence)** = Frequency of incident per year
    
- **ALE (Annual Loss Expectancy)** = SLE × ARO
    

### **Advantages**

- More accurate and objective
    
- Helps in cost–benefit analysis
    
- Useful for management decision-making
    

### **Limitations**

- Requires reliable data
    
- Time-consuming and costly

## **3. Scenario Example (Easy to Remember)**

### **Scenario: Data Center Fire Risk**

### **Qualitative Analysis**

- Threat: Fire in data center
    
- Likelihood: Medium
    
- Impact: High
    
- Risk Level: **High**  
    _(Decided using risk matrix and expert opinion)_
    

### **Quantitative Analysis**

- Asset Value (AV): ₹10,00,000
    
- Exposure Factor (EF): 40%
    
- **SLE = 10,00,000 × 0.4 = ₹4,00,000**
    
- ARO: 0.1 (once in 10 years)
    
- **ALE = 4,00,000 × 0.1 = ₹40,000 per year**
    

This helps management decide whether to invest in fire prevention controls.

## **4. Comparison (Quick Memory Table)**

|Aspect|Qualitative|Quantitative|
|---|---|---|
|Nature|Descriptive|Numerical|
|Accuracy|Less|More|
|Cost|Low|High|
|Data Required|Minimal|Detailed|
|Output|High / Medium / Low|Monetary value|

## **Conclusion**

Qualitative analysis provides a **quick understanding of risk**, while quantitative analysis offers **precise financial impact**. Both are complementary and together provide an effective risk management strategy.
