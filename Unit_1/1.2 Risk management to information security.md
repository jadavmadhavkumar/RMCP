## **Risk Management in Information Security**

### **Definition**

Risk management in information security is a **systematic process of identifying, analyzing, evaluating, and treating risks** to protect information assets such as **data, systems, networks, and services** from threats and vulnerabilities.

---

### **Purpose of Risk Management**

The main goal is to ensure:

- **Confidentiality** – information is not disclosed to unauthorized users
    
- **Integrity** – information is accurate and not altered
    
- **Availability** – information and systems are accessible when needed

### **Key Components of Information Security Risk Management**

1. **Asset Identification**  
    Identify critical assets (databases, servers, applications, user data).
    
2. **Threat Identification**  
    Identify possible threats such as hackers, malware, insider attacks, natural disasters.
    
3. **Vulnerability Identification**  
    Weaknesses like outdated software, weak passwords, lack of backups.
    
4. **Risk Analysis**  
    Assess **likelihood × impact** of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
    
5. **Risk Evaluation**  
    Decide whether the risk is **acceptable or unacceptable**.
    
6. **Risk Treatment**
    
    - **Mitigate** – apply security controls
        
    - **Avoid** – stop risky activity
        
    - **Transfer** – insurance or outsourcing
        
    - **Accept** – tolerate low risks
        
7. **Monitoring and Review**  
    Continuous monitoring and improvement of security controls.

### **Security Controls Used**

- **Technical**: Firewalls, encryption, antivirus
    
- **Administrative**: Security policies, training
    
- **Physical**: Locks, CCTV, access cards

## **Scenario (Exam-Friendly Example)**

### **Scenario: Online Banking System**

A bank stores customer data on a central server.

- **Asset**: Customer financial data
    
- **Threat**: Cyber hacker
    
- **Vulnerability**: Weak password policy
    
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access and data theft
    

### **Risk Management Action**

- Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication
    
- Encrypt sensitive data
    
- Monitor login activities
    

### **Result**

Risk of data breach is **reduced**, ensuring confidentiality and trust.

---

### **Conclusion**

Risk management in information security helps organizations **proactively protect information assets**, reduce losses, comply with standards, and ensure business continuity.

---

### **Memory Tip (for exam)**

Remember **A–T–V–R–T–M**  
**Assets → Threats → Vulnerabilities → Risk → Treatment → Monitoring**
